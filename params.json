{"name":"Bitten","tagline":"A simple implementation of a bit fields attribute for Ruby objects.","body":"# Bitten [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/avdgaag/bitten.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/avdgaag/bitten)\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nBitten is a simple module for adding multiple boolean flags to any Ruby object,\r\nthat internally get stored as a single integer attribute. If your Ruby object\r\nis an ActiveRecord object, it also provides some convenience scopes for you.\r\n\r\nThe advantage is a simple data model, with a single attribute containing many\r\nbits of information. You can keep adding more flags to the list of tracked\r\nflags, as long as the order of existing flags is kept intact.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nBitten is distributed as a Ruby gem, which should be installed on most Macs and\r\nLinux systems. Once you have ensured you have a working installation of Ruby\r\nand Ruby gems, install the gem as follows from the command line:\r\n\r\n    gem install bitten\r\n\r\nTO use it in projects using Bundler, add the gem to your `Gemfile`:\r\n\r\n    gem 'bitten'\r\n\r\nThen, install your gems:\r\n\r\n    bundle install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how to use Bitten:\r\n\r\n     ActiveRecord::Migration.create_table do |t|\r\n       t.integer :bits, null: false, default: 0\r\n     end\r\n  \r\n     class User < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n       include Bitten\r\n       has_bits :editor, :author, :reviewer\r\n     end\r\n  \r\n     user = User.new editor: true\r\n     user.editor? # => true\r\n     user.author? # => false\r\n     user.reviewer? # => false\r\n     user.author = true\r\n     user.author? # => true\r\n     user.save\r\n     User.author # => [user]\r\n     User.editor # => [user]\r\n     User.reviewer # => []\r\n     User.not_reviewer # => [user]\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nSee the inline [API\r\ndocs](http://rubydoc.info/github/avdgaag/bitten/master/frames) for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n### Note on Patches/Pull Requests\r\n\r\n1. Fork the project.\r\n2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n3. Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version\r\n   unintentionally.\r\n4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have\r\n   your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can\r\n   ignore when I pull)\r\n5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues, defects or suggestions in the [Github issue\r\ntracker](https://github.com/avdgaag/bitten/issues).\r\n\r\n### What has changed?\r\n\r\nSee the [HISTORY](https://github.com/avdgaag/bitten/blob/master/HISTORY.md) file\r\nfor a detailed changelog.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nCreated by: Arjan van der Gaag  \r\nURL: [http://arjanvandergaag.nl](http://arjanvandergaag.nl)  \r\nProject homepage: [http://avdgaag.github.com/bitten](http://avdgaag.github.com/bitten)  \r\nDate: september 2013  \r\nLicense: [MIT-license](https://github.com/avdgaag/bitten/blob/master/LICENSE) (same as Ruby)\r\n","google":"UA-20357800-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
